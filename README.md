# Hands-On Deep Learning with TensorFlow
This is the code repository for [Hands-On Deep Learning with TensorFlow](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/hands-deep-learning-tensorflow?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781787282773), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book

## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
import tensorflow as tf
# You can create constants in TF to hold specific values
a = tf.constant(1)
b = tf.constant(2)
```

While this book will show you how to install TensorFlow, there are a few dependencies you need to be aware of. At a minimum, you need a recent version of Python 2 or 3 and NumPy. To get the most out of the book, you should also have Matplotlib and IPython.
